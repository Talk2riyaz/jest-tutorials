CHECK FOR TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
toBeNull matches only null
toBeUndefined matches only undefined
toBeDefined is the opposite of toBeUndefined
toBeTruthy matches anything that an if statement treats as true
toBeFalsy matches anything that an if statement treats as false

toBe is for primitive types, string to be a string etc
to check object, they might be saved in different memory so toBe wont work
